This store is the ORIGINAL game piece seller on Etsy -- we&#39;ve been here doing business since March of 2010, getting better at what we do and adding more and more items to facilitate your board gaming fun!\r\n\r\nMy name&#39;s Tabitha, nice to have you here!  I&#39;m the handmaker of the things in the Epicycle Designs shop.\r\n\r\nSo what&#39;s an epicycle? It&#39;s an astronomical term for a tiny circle orbiting on a larger circle.  An ancient astonomer, Ptolemy, used epicycles to explain the motion of the planets.  Though circles are very simple, the project of describing the huge planet&#39;s motions with those simple circles worked surprisingly well.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found that it sometimes it takes simple things like circles to remind us of the big things, like the planets.  It&#39;s a lofty goal, but I&#39;d like my little teeny-tiny game pieces to remind people of some of the really important stuff in life -- friends, family, and having fun.\r\n\r\nCreatively, I am highly inspired by my grandmother, who taught me how to crochet, weave, sew, and bake bread and cookies at a young age.\r\n\r\nSpiritually, Jesus is my all-in-all and sustains me both in daily life as well as in my creative endeavors.  \r\n\r\nIn all the rest of life, my husband is my love forever, my inspiration, my source of strength.  He deploys often as a Navy pilot, and working on things for this shop helps get me through some of the boredom and loneliness that comes with having him gone.  But we always look forward to playing games together again!","policy_payment":"SECURE OPTIONS\nEtsy keeps your payment information secure.

This store is the ORIGINAL game piece seller on Etsy -- we&#39;ve been here doing business since March of 2010, getting better at what we do and adding more and more items to facilitate your board gaming fun!\r\n\r\nMy name&#39;s Tabitha, nice to have you here!  I&#39;m the handmaker of the things in the Epicycle Designs shop.\r\n\r\nSo what&#39;s an epicycle? It&#39;s an astronomical term for a tiny circle orbiting on a larger circle.  An ancient astonomer, Ptolemy, used epicycles to explain the motion of the planets.  Though circles are very simple, the project of describing the huge planet&#39;s motions with those simple circles worked surprisingly well.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found that it sometimes it takes simple things like circles to remind us of the big things, like the planets.  It&#39;s a lofty goal, but I&#39;d like my little teeny-tiny game pieces to remind people of some of the really important stuff in life -- friends, family, and having fun.\r\n\r\nCreatively, I am highly inspired by my grandmother, who taught me how to crochet, weave, sew, and bake bread and cookies at a young age.\r\n\r\nSpiritually, Jesus is my all-in-all and sustains me both in daily life as well as in my creative endeavors.  \r\n\r\nIn all the rest of life, my husband is my love forever, my inspiration, my source of strength.  He deploys often as a Navy pilot, and working on things for this shop helps get me through some of the boredom and loneliness that comes with having him gone.  But we always look forward to playing games together again!","policy_payment":"SECURE OPTIONS\nEtsy keeps your payment information secure.

This store is the ORIGINAL game piece seller on Etsy -- we&#39;ve been here doing business since March of 2010, getting better at what we do and adding more and more items to facilitate your board gaming fun!\r\n\r\nMy name&#39;s Tabitha, nice to have you here!  I&#39;m the handmaker of the things in the Epicycle Designs shop.\r\n\r\nSo what&#39;s an epicycle? It&#39;s an astronomical term for a tiny circle orbiting on a larger circle.  An ancient astonomer, Ptolemy, used epicycles to explain the motion of the planets.  Though circles are very simple, the project of describing the huge planet&#39;s motions with those simple circles worked surprisingly well.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found that it sometimes it takes simple things like circles to remind us of the big things, like the planets.  It&#39;s a lofty goal, but I&#39;d like my little teeny-tiny game pieces to remind people of some of the really important stuff in life -- friends, family, and having fun.\r\n\r\nCreatively, I am highly inspired by my grandmother, who taught me how to crochet, weave, sew, and bake bread and cookies at a young age.\r\n\r\nSpiritually, Jesus is my all-in-all and sustains me both in daily life as well as in my creative endeavors.  \r\n\r\nIn all the rest of life, my husband is my love forever, my inspiration, my source of strength.  He deploys often as a Navy pilot, and working on things for this shop helps get me through some of the boredom and loneliness that comes with having him gone.  But we always look forward to playing games together again!","policy_payment":"SECURE OPTIONS\nEtsy keeps your payment information secure.

In particular, we find them handy in games where the counter overlaps at 100. We routinely use them when playing Stone Age, Tzolk&#39;in, & Ticket to Ride. Especially when playing with only 2 players, in many of these board games you can do several laps around the score board. These markers will make telling which lap everyone is on easy.\n\nEach counter is laser cut out of quality 3-ply birch plywood. The numbers are laser etched into the surface of the plywood on one side only. The Birch is sanded smooth to the touch but is not finished.\n\nYou can also pick up 50 counters at this link, which we find useful when playing games that scoreboard wraps at 50 points like Carcassonne.","creation_tsz":1474114507,"ending_tsz":1484658907,"original_creation_tsz":1416162090,"last_modified_tsz":1474114507,"price":"10.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":2,"tags":["Laser

There are 5 question mark ports, 2 sheep ships, and 1 ship for each of the other resources (wheat, wood, brick, and stone). \n\nWith our design, all players can see what&#39;s being traded at the ports regardless of where they are sitting!\n\nEach ship is approximately .75&quot; tall and the bases are 1.25&quot; long and 1&quot; wide, just the size to cover over the ships on the seas around the island of Catan.\nThis 11 ship set includes 1 ship each that trade wood, wheat, brick, and ore; 2 ships that trade sheep; and 5 ships that trade any resource 3:1.  Each base is a light blue, to blend into the water in the sea around Catan.  A 3D replica of the building resource being traded by the ship is situated on the base so that the entire table can see their potential ports!\n\nTo use these ships with the 4-player game, please remove one sheep ship, and one 3:1 ship.  Include those two ships if you intend to play with the 5-6 player extension.\nThese ships are compatible with both the base game, the Cities and Knights expansion set, and Seafarers.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------  \nNew to Etsy?

This set of laser-cut birch point counters for board games are a classy way to keep track of your score.\r\n\r\nThese are generic and should work well with many games. In particular, we find them handy in games where the counter overlaps at 50. We routinely use these when playing Carcassonne. Especially when playing with only 2 players, in many board games you can do several laps around the score board. These markers will make telling which lap everyone is on easy.\r\n\r\nEach counter is laser cut out of quality 3-ply birch plywood. The numbers are laser etched into the surface of the plywood on one side only. The Birch is sanded smooth to the touch but is not finished.\r\n\r\nYou can also pick up 100 counters here: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/211394611\/100-point-counters-set-of-8-birch? , which we find useful when playing games that scoreboard wraps at 100 points like Ticket to Ride, T&#39;zolkin, and Stone Age.","creation_tsz":1472817011,"ending_tsz":1483361411,"original_creation_tsz":1419768598,"last_modified_tsz":1472817011,"price":"10.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":4,"tags":["Laser Cut","Carcassonne","Tzolk'in","Ticket to Ride","Stone Age","Eurogame","Counting","Points Marker","board game","game piece set","game tokens","score track marker","50 points"],"category_path":["Toys"],"category_path_ids":[69150393],"materials":["Birch","Wood"],"shop_section_id":10279143,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1463370480,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/216423858\/50-point-counters-for-board-games-set-of?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":193,"num_favorers":6,"shipping_template_id":13921256,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"collective","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":2151,"taxonomy_path":["Toys & Games","Games & Puzzles","Game Pieces"],"used_manufacturer":true,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":703817157,"hex_code":"E6CA83","red":230,"green":202,"blue":131,"hue":43,"saturation":43,"brightness":90,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1419768598,"listing_id":216423858,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/5842569\/il_75x75.703817157_h54s.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/5842569\/il_170x135.703817157_h54s.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/5842569\/il_570xN.703817157_h54s.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/5842569\/il_fullxfull.703817157_h54s.jpg","full_height":800,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":683322430,"hex_code":"98908A","red":152,"green":144,"blue":138,"hue":26,"saturation":9,"brightness":59,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1419768598,"listing_id":216423858,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/060\/0\/5842569\/il_75x75.683322430_nvk5.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/060\/0\/5842569\/il_170x135.683322430_nvk5.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/060\/0\/5842569\/il_570xN.683322430_nvk5.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/060\/0\/5842569\/il_fullxfull.683322430_nvk5.jpg","full_height":800,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":703696518,"hex_code":"BFAC89","red":191,"green":172,"blue":137,"hue":39,"saturation":28,"brightness":74,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1419768598,"listing_id":216423858,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/5842569\/il_75x75.703696518_exre.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/5842569\/il_170x135.703696518_exre.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/5842569\/il_570xN.703696518_exre.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/5842569\/il_fullxfull.703696518_exre.jpg","full_height":800,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":703817159,"hex_code":"DBC488","red":219,"green":196,"blue":136,"hue":43,"saturation":37,"brightness":85,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1419768598,"listing_id":216423858,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/5842569\/il_75x75.703817159_qry2.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/5842569\/il_170x135.703817159_qry2.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/5842569\/il_570xN.703817159_qry2.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/5842569\/il_fullxfull.703817159_qry2.jpg","full_height":800,"full_width":1000}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5842569,"shop_name":"epicycledesigns","user_id":9595319,"creation_tsz":1269437401,"title":"Custom Meeples and Handmade Board Game Tokens","announcement":"Settlers of Catan pieces, Polymer clay meeples, Agricola clay tokens, Lords of Waterdeep dndeeples, Handmade board game tokens, Caverna pieces, replacement board game pieces, gifts for geeky friends, board game bags, and more!\r\n\r\nWant to be privy to upcoming products, discounts, and Epicycle Designs news?

This store is the ORIGINAL game piece seller on Etsy -- we&#39;ve been here doing business since March of 2010, getting better at what we do and adding more and more items to facilitate your board gaming fun!\r\n\r\nMy name&#39;s Tabitha, nice to have you here!  I&#39;m the handmaker of the things in the Epicycle Designs shop.\r\n\r\nSo what&#39;s an epicycle? It&#39;s an astronomical term for a tiny circle orbiting on a larger circle.  An ancient astonomer, Ptolemy, used epicycles to explain the motion of the planets.  Though circles are very simple, the project of describing the huge planet&#39;s motions with those simple circles worked surprisingly well.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found that it sometimes it takes simple things like circles to remind us of the big things, like the planets.  It&#39;s a lofty goal, but I&#39;d like my little teeny-tiny game pieces to remind people of some of the really important stuff in life -- friends, family, and having fun.\r\n\r\nCreatively, I am highly inspired by my grandmother, who taught me how to crochet, weave, sew, and bake bread and cookies at a young age.\r\n\r\nSpiritually, Jesus is my all-in-all and sustains me both in daily life as well as in my creative endeavors.  \r\n\r\nIn all the rest of life, my husband is my love forever, my inspiration, my source of strength.  He deploys often as a Navy pilot, and working on things for this shop helps get me through some of the boredom and loneliness that comes with having him gone.  But we always look forward to playing games together again!","policy_payment":"SECURE OPTIONS\nEtsy keeps your payment information secure.

This store is the ORIGINAL game piece seller on Etsy -- we&#39;ve been here doing business since March of 2010, getting better at what we do and adding more and more items to facilitate your board gaming fun!\r\n\r\nMy name&#39;s Tabitha, nice to have you here!  I&#39;m the handmaker of the things in the Epicycle Designs shop.\r\n\r\nSo what&#39;s an epicycle? It&#39;s an astronomical term for a tiny circle orbiting on a larger circle.  An ancient astonomer, Ptolemy, used epicycles to explain the motion of the planets.  Though circles are very simple, the project of describing the huge planet&#39;s motions with those simple circles worked surprisingly well.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found that it sometimes it takes simple things like circles to remind us of the big things, like the planets.  It&#39;s a lofty goal, but I&#39;d like my little teeny-tiny game pieces to remind people of some of the really important stuff in life -- friends, family, and having fun.\r\n\r\nCreatively, I am highly inspired by my grandmother, who taught me how to crochet, weave, sew, and bake bread and cookies at a young age.\r\n\r\nSpiritually, Jesus is my all-in-all and sustains me both in daily life as well as in my creative endeavors.  \r\n\r\nIn all the rest of life, my husband is my love forever, my inspiration, my source of strength.

The sheaves are designed to represent the number of cultivated fields you have in the popular board game Stone Age.

The wheels are designed after the wagon wheel on the score tracker in each player&#39;s color, and are textured on both sides.\n\nThese tokens are handmade from polymer clay. Each sheaf and wheel is unique. Each wheat token is about 14mm (0.55in) long and fits nicely on the game board&#39;s wheat field tracker, and the wheels are about 15mm in diameter.\n\nIf you are a huge fan of Stone Age, also consider our listing for a full set of replacement Stone Age resources, sold here: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/108691214\/stone-age-handmade-resource-tokens-full?\n\nSafety Note: These pieces are very small and not suitable for children under 3 years old.\n\n------------------------------------------------------ \nNew to Etsy?

Small heads of lettuce replace the boring 10mm vegetable cubes. Manure cubes are replaced with, well, piles of 3D poop. Meat tokens are replaced with juicy T-Bone steaks ready for the BBQ.\n\nIncluded replacement pieces are:\nStarting Player Imp Head (1)\nVegetables, Lettuce (15)\nMeat, Steak (15)\nManure (30)\n\nIf you are interested in customizing more of your copy of Dungeon Petz, contact us about what you would like. We have not yet designed replacement suffering tokens, among other things.\n\nNote: Some of these pieces are very small and are not suitable for children under 3 years

This store is the ORIGINAL game piece seller on Etsy -- we&#39;ve been here doing business since March of 2010, getting better at what we do and adding more and more items to facilitate your board gaming fun!\r\n\r\nMy name&#39;s Tabitha, nice to have you here!  I&#39;m the handmaker of the things in the Epicycle Designs shop.\r\n\r\nSo what&#39;s an epicycle? It&#39;s an astronomical term for a tiny circle orbiting on a larger circle.  An ancient astonomer, Ptolemy, used epicycles to explain the motion of the planets.  Though circles are very simple, the project of describing the huge planet&#39;s motions with those simple circles worked surprisingly well.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found that it sometimes it takes simple things like circles to remind us of the big things, like the planets.  It&#39;s a lofty goal, but I&#39;d like my little teeny-tiny game pieces to remind people of some of the really important stuff in life -- friends, family, and having fun.\r\n\r\nCreatively, I am highly inspired by my grandmother, who taught me how to crochet, weave, sew, and bake bread and cookies at a young age.\r\n\r\nSpiritually, Jesus is my all-in-all and sustains me both in daily life as well as in my creative endeavors.  \r\n\r\nIn all the rest of life, my husband is my love forever, my inspiration, my source of strength.  He deploys often as a Navy pilot, and working on things for this shop helps get me through some of the boredom and loneliness that comes with having him gone.  But we always look forward to playing games together again!","policy_payment":"SECURE OPTIONS\nEtsy keeps your payment information secure.
