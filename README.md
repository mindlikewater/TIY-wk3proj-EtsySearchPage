# Summary

This project is a recreation of an Etsy Search page.

My project can be found at:
[Tai's Etsy Search Page Mockup](https://mindlikewater.github.io/TIY-wk3proj-EtsySearchPage).

# Objective

The goal of this project was to show an understanding of webpage design utilizing SCSS, as well as using Javascript to generate new HTML to a webpage.  Additionally, hover effects should have been applied to the Etsy item boxes (as well as clickable links), but I didn't complete that part of the project.
